               <b> Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel </b>(31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950), endeared as Sardar,
                also known as the <b>Unifier of India</b>, was an Indian statesman. He served as 
                India's first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister from 1947 to 1950. 
                He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, 
                who played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its 
                integration into a united, independent nation.He was one of the conservative members of 
                the Indian National Congress. In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, 
                meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian.</p>

<p id="p1">As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for 
partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. 
He led the task of forging a united India, successfully integrating into the newly independent nation 
those British colonial provinces that formed the Dominion of India. Besides those provinces that 
had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been 
released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. 
Patel persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India. </p>

   <p id="p1">His commitment to national integration in the newly independent country was total and 
    uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet <b>"Iron Man of India"</b>.</p>


    <p id="p1">He is also remembered as the <b>Patron Saint </b> India's civil servants 
        for having established the modern <b>All India Services system.</b>
        The<b><i> Statue of Unity </i></b>, the world's tallest statue, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and 
        is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height 
    </p>.

<h2>Father of All India Services</h2>
<p id="p2">
    He was also instrumental in the creation of the <b>All India Services</b> which he described as the
     country's <i>Steel Frame</i>.
</p>
<p id="p2">
    He,realised the crucial role that 
    civil services play in administering a country, in not merely maintaining law and order, 
    but running the institutions that provide the binding cement to a society.
    The present-day all-India administrative services owe their origin to the man's sagacity and thus he is 
    regarded as<b> Father of modern All India Services.</b>

  <b>  Rashtriya Ekta Diwas</b> (National Unity Day) was introduced by the Government of India and 
    inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. The intent is to pay tribute to Patel, 
    who was instrumental in keeping India united. It is to be celebrated on<b> 31 October </b> every year as 
    annual commemoration of the birthday of the <b>Iron Man of India Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</b>,
     one of the founding leaders of<b> Republic of India</b>.

<h2>Statue of Unity</h2>
<p id="p4">
    The <b>Statue of Unity</b> is a monument dedicated to Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, located in the Indian state of Gujarat, 
    facing the Narmada Dam, 3.2 km away from Sadhu Bet near Vadodara. At the height of 182 metres 
    (597 feet), it is the world's tallest statue, exceeding the Spring Temple Buddha by 54 meters. 
    This statue and related structures are spread over 20,000 square meters and are surrounded by an 
    artificial lake spread across 12 km and cost an estimated 29.8 billion rupees ($425m).
    It was inaugurated by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 31 October 2018, the 
    143rd anniversary of Patel's birth. The height of the statue in meters has been picked to match 
    the total assembly constituencies in Gujarat
